# Safe-Reinforcement-Learning-via-Symbolic-Logical-Programming-for-Autonomous-Highway-Driving
Use Symbolic Logical Programming to find Safe actions in each state and help Reinforcment Learning to ensure safety in the exploration phase. We use it to make decision in Autonomous Highway Driving. 

You can find the code and paper in this [Repository](https://github.com/CAV-Research-Lab/Safe-Reinforcement-Learning-using-Symbolic-Logical-Programming-for-Autonomous-Highway-Driving). I am the main contributor of the project.
